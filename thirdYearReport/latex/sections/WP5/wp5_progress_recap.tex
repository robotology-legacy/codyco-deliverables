\paragraph*{WP5: systems integration, standardization and evaluation on the iCub robot (IIT)}

The third year WP5 activities have concentrated on the third year validation scenario. A complete
description of the scenario can be found in ``D5.3 Scientific report on validation scenario 3:
balancing on compliant environmental contacts.'' \cite{deliverable53} which discusses the technical
implementation of the third year validation scenario (see
\url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-deliverables/tree/master/D5.3/pdf}). With
respect to the state of the art the work progress represents a step towards whole-body torque
control under postural, contacts and goal-directed constraints. The integration of tactile
feedback within the whole-body controller is a peculiarity of the implemented CoDyCo validation
scenario and therefore represents yet another step forward with respect to the current state of
the art.
