Within T4.1 IIT developed a theoretical framework for estimating whole-body dynamics from distributed multimodal sensors \cite{Nori2015}. Considered sensors include joint encoders, gyroscopes, accelerometers and force/torque sensors. Estimated quantities are position, velocity, acceleration and (internal and external) wrenches on all the rigid bodies composing the robot articulated chain. The estimation procedure consists of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) which gives the a-posteriori estimation given all the available measurements. Computational efficiency is obtained by formulating the Kalman filter update-step with a sparse Bayesian network. Experiments for validating the proposed theoretical framework have been conducted on a leg of the iCub humanoid robot. The iCub is an ideal platform for the proposed experiment given its distributed force, torque, linear acceleration and angular velocity sensors. Results have shown the accuracy and the computational efficiency of the proposed method. The theoretical framework has been implemented in an open source software (see also Section \ref{sec:T15}).
